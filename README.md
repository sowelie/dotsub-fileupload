# dotsub-fileupload

Simple file upload demo that uses AngularJS for the UI as well as Spring Framework and Hibernate for the back end API.

1. (optional) Edit fileupload-api/src/main/resources/application.properties and set the directory to a path of your choosing.
1. Run ./gradlew --parallel runAll (gradlew.bat --parallel runAll on Windows)
1. A browser window will open once the project has been fully built (note the first time can take a while and it may even appear like nothing is happening while the npm install is running).
